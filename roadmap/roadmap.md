# Roadmap for Duino-Coin NFT Implementation
## Inspiration
Inspiration to innovate [Duino-Coin](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin) -based [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token) for real physical products comes of current ongoing Russian war against Ukraina, because innocent people are dying there just now and this can be one way to say to Putin, that he is doing wrong things and we don't accept it and that we want to help Ukraina people. But even if Ukraina-case is very very important for us, if we want keep as human people, one very bad thing can also lead good things. Duino-Coin NFT will be [smart contract](https://cyberscrilla.com/nft-smart-contracts-explained/) -project for categorised agreements for products in selling and buiing them so that each piece can be identifield by its NFT, so nothing like this has not even been possible before. If we can make full-version of categorised NFT agreements, it is possible to check history of a single product of what components it consist and do they fullfill same category agreement, than main product clains to fullfill.

Also with components have just same NFT history data available of sellers and buyers if they fullfill category rules or not, so real controll to real data of how products are made can be available as component level. Even if component is dismanted from one old product and sold to someone, who installs that component to his/her product, new one or old one, also that components history can be found, when component is sold with it's NFT. So business possibities for this kind NFT-usage seems to be very promising if you are going to save the world or even if your are not going to do it.
 
## Steps
### Smart Agreement
### Study Agreements.
#### Study GPL
 Study GPL as a purpose to define Smart Agreement same kind as GPL so, that agreement maker promises publish all components  he /her has used as a list with NFT-information needed for each.
### Study NFT
 In Internet there can be found guides, how NFT can be made for at lesat digital thing with Etheriums. Make a study how to do it with Duino-Coin.
