# Roadmap for Duino-Coin NFT Implementation
## Inspiration
Inspiration to innovate [Duino-Coin](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin) -based [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) for real physical products comes of current ongoing Russian war against Ukraina, because innocent people are dying there just now and this can be one way to say to Putin, that he is doing wrong things and we don't accept it and that we want to help Ukraina people. But even if Ukraina-case is very very important for us, if we want keep as human people, one very bad thing can also lead good things. Nothing like this has not even been possible before. If we can make full-version of categorised smart contracts, it is possible to check history of a single product of what components it consists and do they fullfill same category contract, than main product clains to fullfill.

Also with components have just same smart contract history data available of sellers and buyers if they fullfill category rules or not, so real controll to real data of how products are made can be available as component level. Even if component is dismanted from one old product and sold to someone, who installs that component to his/her product, new one or old one, also that components history can be found, when component is sold with it's NFT. So business possibities for this kind NFT-usage seems to be very promising if you are going to save the world or even if your are not going to do it.
 
## Steps
### Block-Chain
### Categosized Smart Contracts
Basic idea is based on Categirised Contracts
#### Category
Category for a componen can be based on conditions with a component has build, traded or owned. One example is Russia ban. This category may be defined for instance so, that componen has not beem nade is Russia, not a company that is owned by any people that are citizens by Russia directly or indirectly, phopin use of bullvans. Example of conditions contract may be, that conditions of the workers fullfill some category difined for instance [ILO C029 - Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29)](https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=NORMLEXPUB:12100:0::NO::P12100_ILO_CODE:C029). Very popular cateryry is nowdays climate carbon neutral, for instance for [Design Buildings](https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Carbon_neutral_contract). This contract is easy to be extended to any area of the business products.
### Contract Makers
Basically Contract is one-sided. They are promisesto fo follow those caterory conttracts rules. Producer companies make those promiseses of their products, components or services. Product consist on many components and services of many companies. Chain goes from component makers to product maker to shops, where customer can buy those products.

In this tranfer chain component is always holded by one acror. We can identify two typoe component holder change dependent of that, is component buyed to not is ownership changed or not. Those actors have made categorised contracts how they behave with that component. Wecan ientify asigment between component, actor and contract.

If we look situation in the shop, customer can find out a product that consista of components and services. Even the shop selling assings a service to a product what it is selling and have nade promises how it works. Customer can find out products all components and services and get information od all vategorized contract made ot not made.

On selling phase customer can choose a produuct by a categorized contract and if product does not fullfil this contracts by some component or service, customer can see what is wrong with that product or simply get a list o other products that fullfill the contract wanted. We can find out that with this logic we have made a system, where customer can choose his/her values and put his/her money to talk how this world should act.

What thid projects will sell.

This projects product will be product sticker that includes a QR-code, which has identification information of a prodeucts. From that customer can check if a product fullfilss smart contracts he/she wants. Lokk car componts, cellular phone boxes aetc. All products have stickers, where are many kind is-information. This Categorized Contracts sticker is one more. With that sticker product makers can get get godwill for their products,  products, because they act responsible.

### Block-Chain
#### Study Block_Chains
#### Study Duino as Block_Chain
Read-only logging is basic feature of a block-chain, but is Duino a block-chain? If yes, how we con log with Duino? If not, is it possible to wrap Duino-Coin to some block-chain?

Suggstion by bobyblobfish#1566: "... make a duino nft on polygon blockchain, and make an official section on the duinocoin website that lets you buy the nfts with duco, but actually it buys it with polygon by exchanging the duino to polygon through the website. Now we have duino nfts that  are decentralized, and also doesnâ€™t force anyone to directly use anything besides duino to buy it." In this use case we should put "smart contract" on a polygon blockchain to keep consepts clear, because it seems that nft is always asociated to some digital thing, but here we have smart contract, which is digital itself, but it is associated to a flysical thing like a component of a product.

Your need wallet and Secret Recovery Phrase. Don't yet know if Duino-Coin Web wallet can be used. In this study I created a new wallet and Secret Recovery Phrase. After creating wallet with a phase, it if I try to add network
- Network Name
- New RPC URL
- Chain ID
- Currency Symbol(Optional)
- Block Explorer URL(Optional)

For Etherium these are
- Network Name 			Ethereum Mainnet
- New RPC URL  			***
- Chain ID				1
- Currency Symbol(Optional)		ETH
- Block Explorer URL(Optional)	https://etherscan.io

For tests can be used for instance
- Localhost 8545
- Ropsten Test Network

To continue study, maybe Ropsten Test Network is best.

- Network Name				Ropsten Test Network
- New RPC URL				***
- Chain ID				3	
- Currency Symbol(Optional) 		ETH
- Block Explorer URL(Optional)	https://ropsten.etherscan.io

Hmm.. this is already included, because I can't add it

Currency can be for istance bitcoin, dollar, but no DUCO.


### Smart Contract
#### Study Smart Contracts
How to deploy smart contract? Youcan use ethereum as example, but ethereus is not cheap main think to study is we can lof with Duino, how we deploy smart contyracts with Duino?

### GPL
#### Study GPL
 Study GPL as a purpose to define Smart Contract same kind as GPL so, that contract maker promises publish all components  he/her has used as a list with Smart Contract -information needed for each.
