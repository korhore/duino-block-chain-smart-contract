# Roadmap for Duino-Coin NFT Implementation
## Inspiration
Inspiration to innovate [Duino-Coin](https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin) -based [smart contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) for real physical products comes of current ongoing Russian war against Ukraina, because innocent people are dying there just now and this can be one way to say to Putin, that he is doing wrong things and we don't accept it and that we want to help Ukraina people. But even if Ukraina-case is very very important for us, if we want keep as human people, one very bad thing can also lead good things. Nothing like this has not even been possible before. If we can make full-version of categorised smart contracts, it is possible to check history of a single product of what components it consists and do they fullfill same category contract, than main product clains to fullfill.

Also with components have just same smart contract history data available of sellers and buyers if they fullfill category rules or not, so real controll to real data of how products are made can be available as component level. Even if component is dismanted from one old product and sold to someone, who installs that component to his/her product, new one or old one, also that components history can be found, when component is sold with it's NFT. So business possibities for this kind NFT-usage seems to be very promising if you are going to save the world or even if your are not going to do it.
 
## Steps
### Block-Chain
#### Study Block_Chains
#### Study Duino as Block_Chain
Read-only logging is basic feature of a block-chain, but is Duino a block-chain? If yes, how we con log with Duino? If not, is it possible to wrap Duino-Coin to some block-chain?

Suggstion by bobyblobfish#1566: "... make a duino nft on polygon blockchain, and make an official section on the duinocoin website that lets you buy the nfts with duco, but actually it buys it with polygon by exchanging the duino to polygon through the website. Now we have duino nfts that  are decentralized, and also doesnâ€™t force anyone to directly use anything besides duino to buy it." In this use case we should put "smart contract" on a polygon blockchain to keep consepts clear, because it seems that nft is always asociated to some digirtal thing, but here we have smart contract, which is digital itself, but it is associated to a flysical thing like a component of a product.

### Smart Contract
#### Study Smart Contracts
How to deploy smart contract? Youcan use ethereum as example, but ethereus is not cheap main think to study is we can lof with Duino, how we deploy smart contyracts with Duino?

### GPL
#### Study GPL
 Study GPL as a purpose to define Smart Contract same kind as GPL so, that contract maker promises publish all components  he/her has used as a list with Smart Contract -information needed for each.
