duino-coin nft work

##Introduction
With NFT you can keep track of owners of real things. With NFT you can also make smart contracts.  We can combine these things. You can keep track who has made a component, because that who is the first owner of a component. Anyone can check  this from the NFT and NFT is public. Products are made of components. With NFT we can keep track how component move between manufacturers, that make products for the customers.

If we make an agreement like GPL that manufacturer should/can publish all components used  in his/her product as NFT and those components have also NFT we can find out in what country those all components are made. This logic works and no matter how  long components chain is. That way we can for instance know if some components are made in Russia. Or in realistic way, no components made in Russia newer will include that kind of NFT, but manufacturer can choose clean components made in countries, that don't make war.

This is an example of a category of a product. Another can be some category, that saves the climate. Why use Duino-Coin to make NFT? Why not, because price of a Duino-Coin is cheap, so this can be big thing, "clean" manufacturers can take it in use, because it is goodwill for their products and costs for it are low.  If we can get this running, we can save lives with our raspberrys, make world better. A little or at least try.
