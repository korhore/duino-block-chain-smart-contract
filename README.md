duino block-chain smart-contract work

## Introduction
With a block-chain you can make smart contracts because block-chain's basic feature is implement a readd-only log and it is not limited, whar you log. If we make contracts how and where manufacturer's have made thbair product and what have been conditios where production is done. Nowdyw product are made of components that can be handled product like, so procys agreements can be handled nested. Procts fulfiils some kind agreement if it and if all components fullfii the contract.

With smart contract we can also log producre - first owner - and all next owners of of product as component level. We can even track used components trade from one used main product to next used main product. Example of this are for instance car-compomponents, which are expensive and if you have used car with a need to replace some component, it is not economiically or for envronmental reasons wice to use new expensive components. With this kind component level log we have history of components so we use xactly owner ow a components and can get component history. Not yet this kind of feature has not been possible.

If we make an contracts like GPL that manufacturer should/can publish all components used in his/her product as smart contractswe can also find out in what country those all components are made. This logic works and no matter how  long components chain is. That way we can for instance know if some components are made for instace in Russia. Soi with this feature wa can iomp√•lemts trade bans that are hard to evade. In realistic way, no components made in Russia newer will include that kind of smart agreement, but manufacturer can choose clean components made in countries, that don't make war.

This is an example of a category of a product. Another can be some category, that saves the climate. Why use Duino -Coin to make smart contracts for products as component level? Why not, because price of a Duino-Coin is cheap, so this can be big thing, "clean" manufacturers can take it in use, because it is goodwill for their products and costs for it are low.  If we can get this running, we can save lives with our raspberrys, make world better. A little or at least try.
